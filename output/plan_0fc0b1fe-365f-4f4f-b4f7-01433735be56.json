A 30-35 year old man, exhausted, with unkempt dark hair and a shadow of stubble, wearing a rumpled, plain dark t-shirt. His bloodshot eyes are strained, reflecting the intense blue-green glow of a trading chart on a monitor. Visible pores and deep fatigue lines around his eyes, skin texture showing imperfection. Extreme close-up (ECU) on his eyes and slightly trembling fingers hovering over a worn keyboard, centered in safe zone. Harsh practical lighting from a single, intensely blue monitor screen acting as key light, casting deep, oppressive shadows under his eyes and chin. No fill light. A faint, warm practical light (desk lamp) barely illuminates the edge of his temple, creating a motivated rim. Shadows go to pure black. Heavy sensor noise from pushed ISO 6400, prominent 35mm film grain overlay, pronounced halation bleeding from the monitor glow into his face, subtle chromatic aberration on edges. Gritty, desaturated look with strong cool blue tones dominating, creating a feeling of oppressive coldness. High contrast with deep, crushed blacks and pronounced shadows, minimal mid-tones. Shallow depth of field with soft focus falloff on background elements, emphasizing his face. Shot on Sony FX3 with a vintage Helios 44-2 lens, captured at 1080p, natural skin texture visible.",

The same 30-35 year old man from scene 1, now leaning back in his chair, hands gently resting on the desk, eyes still a bit tired but visibly relaxed, looking at a monitor showing green upward-ticking numbers. His posture is finally released from tension, slight smile of relief. Visible pores and natural skin texture. Static medium shot (MS) of the man, chest to head framing, showing his upper body and the top of the monitor, centered in safe zone. Softer, diffused morning light filtering through blinds, gently illuminating his face from the side. The blue monitor glow is still present but softened, now complemented by the natural light, creating a sense of calm. Shadows are still present but not as harsh, providing gentle contour. Heavy sensor noise, prominent 35mm film grain overlay, subtle halation. Transitioning to a slightly warmer, more neutral color palette, still retaining grit and natural imperfection. High contrast, with lifted shadows but still deep blacks, reflecting a quiet shift to relief. Natural skin texture. Shot on Sony FX3 with a vintage Helios 44-2 lens, captured at 1080p.",

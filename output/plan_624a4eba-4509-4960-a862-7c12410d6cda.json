A 30-year-old female professional with sleek, shoulder-length dark brown hair, wearing a loose-fitting, soft grey silk sleep shirt, her face serene and relaxed in deep sleep, centered in safe zone. Extreme close-up (ECU) on the woman's closed eye, showing minute skin texture and the delicate flutter of her eyelashes. Dramatic side lighting from a cool blue LED (simulating moonlight) creating deep shadows on one side of her face, with a subtle rim light from the opposite side highlighting the contours of her cheek and hair, studio black infinity background for complete isolation, hard directional key light sculpts form. fuji_film_stock color grade with Fuji Eterna 500T emulation.

Above her, an abstract, ethereal 3D visualization of an 'Invisible Engine' AI trading agent manifests as glowing, interconnected geometric forms (cubes, spheres, lines) in elegant, swift motion, representing data and trades. Medium shot (MS), initially showing her chest to head, then expanding as the crane moves up to reveal the abstract AI above her. Rembrandt lighting on the sleeping woman with a soft box key light (cool blue) at 45 degrees defining her peaceful face. The abstract 3D AI elements glow with internal, soft green and gold light, subtly reflecting on the dark gradient background, high-end studio setup with volumetric haze catching light beams. fuji_film_stock color grade with Fuji Eterna 500T emulation.

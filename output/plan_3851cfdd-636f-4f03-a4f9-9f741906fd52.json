Natural skin texture with visible pores, fatigue lines, stubble shadow. A tired man in his late 30s, sallow skin, deep under-eye circles, wearing a wrinkled t-shirt and sweatpants, his hair disheveled. He sits hunched over a glowing laptop at a cluttered desk in a dim, urban apartment. Locked-off Steadicam with subtle breathing, claustrophobic framing. Medium Full Shot (MFS) of the man and his laptop, slightly low angle. Single harsh laptop screen as the key light, casting blue tones on his face. Practicals only visible (a small desk lamp with a visible tungsten filament), deep shadows consuming the apartment beyond the desk. Vintage analog film look, blue and desaturated tones dominating, pronounced screen glow halation.

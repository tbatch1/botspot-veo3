Heavy halation bleeding from streetlamps and neon signage. 35mm anamorphic squeeze with oval bokeh. Visible gate weave and splice marks. ISO 800 grain structure with clumped emulsion texture. Chromatic aberration on wide shots, particularly cyan/magenta fringing on rain-slicked surfaces. Extreme close-up on the rain-slicked, worn leather of a weathered male detective's trench coat collar, a single drop of rain catching the artificial light, subtly reflecting a distant distorted neon sign. The dark brown/olive green fabric shows visible wear and tear, and fine threads are illuminated. Extreme close-up (ECU) on the rain-soaked collar, focused tightly on the water droplets and coarse fabric, centered in safe zone. Heavy halation bleeding from a distant sodium vapor streetlamp, casting sickly orange and deep shadows across the wet fabric. Minimal fill. Specular highlights from rain bloom and flare. Crushed blacks and muddy midtones, heavy halation, ISO 800 grain structure with clumped emulsion texture. Chromatic aberration, particularly cyan/magenta fringing on rain-slicked surfaces. Paranoid, oppressive, morally ambiguous mood, realistic, filmic. Anamorphic 35mm film format.",

Chromatic aberration on wide shots, particularly cyan/magenta fringing on rain-slicked surfaces. The same weathered male detective from scene 1, mid-50s, tired eyes, stubbled face, wearing his rumpled, rain-soaked dark brown/olive green trench coat, a stained white shirt, and loosened dark tie. He holds a bulky rotary telephone receiver to his ear. His face is half-lit, eyes often lost in darkness. Medium shot (MS) of the detective, chest to head framing, slightly low angle looking up, isolating him against the grimy background, centered in safe zone. Single practical desk lamp casting harsh lines across his face, revealing sweat and exhaustion. Deep shadows envelop the rest of the room. Sodium vapor light from outside leaks through a grimy window, creating a sickly orange hue. Crushed blacks and muddy midtones, heavy halation, ISO 800 grain structure with clumped emulsion texture. Paranoid, oppressive, morally ambiguous mood. The city is indifferent, hostile, realistic, filmic. Anamorphic 35mm film format.",

Chromatic aberration on wide shots, particularly cyan/magenta fringing on rain-slicked surfaces. The same weathered male detective from scene 1, his rumpled dark brown/olive green trench coat visible, standing isolated in a vast, dimly lit, concrete parking garage, surrounded by abstract shadows. He is seen head-to-toe, looking small against the imposing environment. Wide shot (WS), detective head-to-toe visible in the lower third of the frame, towering concrete pillars and dim, flickering fluorescent lights filling the upper frame, creating an oppressive atmosphere, centered in safe zone. Single flickering fluorescent light source from above, casting long, distorted shadows and deep, oppressive darkness. Volumetric haze visible in the light beams, adding to the dramatic contrast and mysterious mood. Crushed blacks and muddy midtones, heavy halation from the flickering light. ISO 800 grain structure with clumped emulsion texture, chromatic aberration on wide shots. Paranoid, oppressive, morally ambiguous, dangerous, lived-in, realistic, filmic.

    "narrative_arc": "A weathered detective receives a cryptic phone call that pulls him back into a case he thought was buried. Rain-soaked streets and flickering neon become his confessional as he descends through a web of corruption that reaches higher than he ever imagined. The trailer climaxes with a confrontation in a dimly lit parking garage—truth revealed, but justice uncertain.",

      "lighting_notes": "Practicals only—sodium vapor streetlights casting sickly orange pools, neon signs providing accent color (predominantly red and blue). Deep shadows with minimal fill. Faces half-lit, eyes often lost in darkness. Rain creates specular highlights that bloom and flare. Interior scenes lit by single desk lamps or venetian blind slats cutting harsh lines across faces.",
      "camera_notes": "Handheld with subtle breathing movement during dialogue. Slow zooms during revelations (70s Pakula/Lumet style). Whip pans between suspects. Low angles looking up at towering buildings, high angles isolating the detective in empty streets. Rack focuses that arrive slightly late, as if the camera operator is discovering the scene in real-time."

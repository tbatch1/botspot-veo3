A 30-year-old male trader, visibly exhausted, with dark circles under his bloodshot eyes, stubble on his face, wearing a crumpled dark t-shirt. His fingers are stained with dried coffee. Extreme close-up (ECU) on his bloodshot eye reflecting endless green candlestick charts, then slowly pushing into his trembling fingertips hovering over a mechanical keyboard, then back to his sweat-sheen face. Harsh, unflattering illumination from multiple monitor screens creating a sickly blue-green glow, complemented by a single desk lamp casting deep shadows under his eyes. No fill light. Darkness eats the frame edges. Heavy halation blooms from monitor glow. Teal and orange color grade with high contrast, crushed blacks for cinematic depth, warm skin tones against cool backgrounds, gritty Netflix documentary look. Shot on handheld Bolex 16mm film camera aesthetic, Kodak Vision3 500T film stock pushed two stops for heavy grain and crushed blacks, Anamorphic Kowa lenses with visible chromatic aberration on edges, high ISO sensor noise, 2.39:1 anamorphic cinematic scope aspect ratio. Important subjects centered in 80% safe zone.",

The same 30-year-old male trader from scene 1, now sleeping peacefully, head resting on his arms on the desk, the monitors behind him dimly glowing, showing Botspot running automatically. Medium shot (MS), chest to head framing, showing his relaxed posture. Subtly softer practical lighting compared to scene 1, with a muted glow from the now-automated trading desk screens and a faint, distant ambient practical light. Still no direct fill light, but the harshness on his face is absent, replaced by gentle shadows. Darkness still surrounds the frame edges. Teal and orange color grade with high contrast, crushed blacks for cinematic depth, warm skin tones against cool backgrounds, gritty Netflix documentary look.

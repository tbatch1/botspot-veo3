His face is illuminated by the harsh blue-white glow of a laptop screen, creating deep shadows under his eyes. Medium Wide Shot (MWS), slightly high angle looking down, showing the trader at his kitchen table, laptop prominent, with glimpses of the dark kitchen background. Only practical lighting from a single warm tungsten desk lamp in the periphery and the laptop screen itself. Deep, dark shadows fill the background. No artificial fill. Desaturated, gritty, with lifted blacks and a prominent 16mm film grain texture. Color temperature leans cool from the laptop on his face, contrasting with the warm practical lamp in the room. Documentary realism. Shot on a vintage digital cinema camera emulating a 16mm film look, 35mm equivalent lens, slight focus hunting on his face. Centered in safe zone.",

The laptop screen's blue light reflects in his pupils. Dominated by the sickly blue-white light from the laptop screen illuminating his face. The warm practical lamp is now out of frame, leaving the background in deeper darkness. Same desaturated, grainy, documentary realism.

The warm tungsten practical lamp, previously a background element, now becomes the primary key light, casting warm amber on his face and the table. Shadows shift and deepen.

The warm tungsten practical lamp illuminates the table area. The hallway he walks into is almost entirely dark, a deep void. The ambient light in the kitchen is minimal, emphasizing the 'late night' feel. Desaturated, grainy, with deep blacks and the 16mm texture.

Warm tungsten practicals (desk lamp, kitchen light) create pools of amber against deep shadows. The camera feels present, almost voyeuristic, catching a real moment. Color grade should be desaturated, slightly lifted blacks, with that distinctive 16mm texture. No polish, no gloss—just truth.",
    "narrative_arc": "We find a exhausted trader alone at his kitchen table, bathed in laptop glow, the weight of endless market-watching etched on his face.

    "audience_hook": "Every trader knows the prison of 24/7 markets—the anxiety of sleeping while money moves. This taps into the universal exhaustion of constant vigilance and offers the emotional release of permission to let go. It's not about getting rich; it's about getting your life back.",

When he walks away, let him move into darkness—the bedroom hallway should be barely visible. No artificial bounce, no beauty lighting.",
      "camera_notes": "Handheld with subtle drift and breathing—never locked off. Stay on a 35mm or 50mm equivalent for intimacy. Allow slight focus hunting. One slow push-in on his tired face, then a static wide as he walks away. Movement should feel observational, like a documentarian trying not to disturb the moment."

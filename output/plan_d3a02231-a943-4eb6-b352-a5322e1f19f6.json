Kodak Vision3 500T 5219 emulation with pushed processing. ISO 4000 sensor noise visible in shadow areas. Chromatic aberration on edge highlights from cheap glass simulation. 16mm Bolex B-roll intercuts with heavy gate weave and film grain structure. A 28-year-old androgynous figure with short, dark, spiky hair, wearing a distressed oversized black trench coat made of a heavy, waxed canvas, dark cargo pants, and worn-out, high-top combat boots, their face partially obscured by rain and shadow, standing in a rain-drenched Tokyo alleyway. Keep subject in center 80%. Extreme wide shot (EWS), vast environment visible with flickering holographic advertisements and vibrant neon signs, subject small in epic space, grand cinematic scale, establishing geography, with a subtle handheld feel simulating operator breathing. Low-key chiaroscuro with hard single-source key light from a distant neon sign (magenta and cyan hues), deep dramatic shadows across half the frame casting mystery, film noir aesthetic, 3:1 key-to-fill ratio for high contrast, theatrical mood. Practicals only, no fill light. Deep blacks crushed in grade. Rain catching light as streaking particles. Teal and orange color grade with high contrast, crushed blacks for cinematic depth, warm skin tones against cool backgrounds, blockbuster film aesthetic, theatrical release quality. Palpable humidity—every surface wet, every light source diffused through moisture. Shot on Arri Alexa LF full-frame sensor, 4.5K resolution, professional cinema camera, with a 24mm f/1.4 wide-angle prime lens, leveraging full-frame sensor depth for dramatic subject isolation.",

Medium shot (MS), chest to head framing, standard dialogue composition, balanced and relatable, conversational distance. Macro insert of steam rising from industrial brewing apparatus, then the coffee cup. Low-key chiaroscuro with hard single-source key light from harsh neon tubes (amber and magenta) casting dramatic shadows across weathered faces, film noir aesthetic, 3:1 key-to-fill ratio for high contrast, theatrical mood. Practicals only. Deep blacks crushed in grade. Motivated light sources creating hard shadows with soft halation halos. Teal and orange color grade with high contrast, crushed blacks for cinematic depth, warm skin tones against cool backgrounds, blockbuster film aesthetic, theatrical release quality.

Keep subject/cup in center 80%. Close-up (CU) of the figure's eyes, then a macro insert on the coffee cup, face fills frame, emotional detail and subtle nuance visible, an intimate revelation of profound focus. Hard directional light from a single, unseen fluorescent flicker, creating deep blacks and bold dramatic shadows, a fashion editorial aesthetic, striking visual impact, magazine-quality lighting. Practical light only, no fill. Teal and orange color grade with high contrast, crushed blacks for cinematic depth, warm skin tones against cool backgrounds, blockbuster film aesthetic, theatrical release quality. The perception of the city outside shifting from chaos to ordered patterns, conveyed through the figure's intense focus.

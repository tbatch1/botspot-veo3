> "Slow motion is frequently recommended for emphasizing drama or beauty in video generations. Control the energy of your video: 'Slow motion' - emphasize drama or beauty"

**Best Practice Example:**
```
"Fresh strawberry being dipped into rich melted chocolate, chocolate dripping off
in slow motion, dark moody background, dramatic side lighting highlighting texture,
close-up macro shot, shallow depth of field"
```

### Effective Slow Motion Keywords (2025)

**Primary Keywords:**
- `"slow motion"` - General slow-mo effect
- `"dramatic slow motion"` - Emphasizes drama
- `"extreme slow motion"` - Ultra-slow, high detail
- `"120fps slow motion"` - Technical specification
- `"time dilation effect"` - Cinematic slow-down

**Pairing Recommendations:**
- Slow motion + Macro close-up = Maximum detail capture
- Slow motion + Backlighting = Dramatic particle effects
- Slow motion + Shallow DOF = Cinematic product shots

### Application by Genre

Subject: Demo Deliverables - AI Commercial Studio (Showroom + Long-Form Spots)

Hi [Name],

Sharing the demo deliverables from our AI Commercial Studio.

What we built
- Studio UI: end-to-end workflow (strategy -> shotlist -> images -> motion clips -> VO/music mix -> final render).
- Showroom: auto-updating gallery of finished renders (review, download MP4, favorite, delete).
- Remix workflow: re-cast voices / adjust timing / re-mix audio on an existing project without regenerating visuals.

Why the demo is mostly short-form (intentional constraints during build)
- We used 15s spots heavily while building to keep iteration fast and costs low.
- Motion generation is constrained to 4/6/8 second clips per request, so long-form is assembled from multiple scenes.
- Short-form lets us validate reliability (visual consistency, timing sync, audio mix) before scaling up to large batches.

Long-form capability
- The same Studio workflow generates 30s and 60s spots (more scenes, more VO, more motion generation, longer assembly).
- For development/testing we kept long-form runs limited until the pipeline was stable end-to-end.

Audio / voice approach
- The system supports multiple voice providers and quick re-casting via Remix.
- For demo playback we mix VO-forward so dialogue stays clear above background music.

With budget, we can raise quality further
- Post-production polish: upscale/cleanup (Topaz Video AI), denoise, stabilization, stronger grading.
- Voice upgrades: larger premium voice libraries, better casting controls (accent/age/style), and consistent character voices.
- Audio upgrades: higher quality music/SFX sources, tighter mastering, and licensed tracks where required.
- Visual upgrades: longer narratives, more scenes, more cut variety, and higher-fidelity motion generation.


Thanks,
